Spurt in Travel Abroad Cuts Japan's Large Trade Surplus After fruitless years of struggling with Japan to negotiate down its yawning trade surpluses, foreign governments are getting help from an unlikely source: 10 million Japanese with a passion for overseas travel.   With all those yen and dollars being spent offshore as Japanese ''import'' hotel lodging, restaurant meals and myriad other travel services, Japan's financial surpluses are shrinking quickly, even while many thorny trade issues remain unresolved.   ''To our surprise, travel services have become Japan's second-largest 'import,' after oil,'' said Koji Watanabe, the deputy minister for foreign affairs and a top official representing Japan in current trade negotiations with the United States. Travel, Mr. Watanabe added, represents ''one of the most promising areas for Japan to increase its imports.'' A Large Travel Deficit    In the first nine months of this year, Japan ran a $14.5 billion travel deficit, meaning that is how much more Japanese travelers spent overseas than foreign travelers spent in Japan. With a year-end surge beginning - travel agents estimate that a half-million Japanese will go abroad for the holidays - the Government expects the deficit to top $20 billion for the year. That would more than double the $8.7 billion travel deficit in 1987 and would represent a fivefold increase from the $3.7 billion gap in 1985.   The total of 10 million overseas travelers includes both tourists and people on business trips and is nearly double the level of three years ago. Some experts maintain that the figures would be much higher were it not for serious bottlenecks at Japan's undersized, overburdened international airports, which can make overseas travel an ordeal.   ''Not only are people spending these huge amounts on travel, but they all bring back lots of omiyage,'' said Susumo Saito, chief economist here for a unit of Credit Suisse, using the Japanese word for gifts. ''The cumulative amounts have been getting very big,'' Mr. Saito said.   The typical Japanese tourist will go abroad for six to seven days, spending $1,750 on travel and an additional $1,000 or so on goods, according to the Japan Travel Bureau, the nation's largest travel agent.   The favorite destinations are in the Pacific Rim. More than a million Japanese visited Hawaii last year, and a similar number also traveled to South Korea and to Hong Kong.   Japan's travel deficit with the United States alone represented more than a third of its worldwide travel gap in 1988. This year, a growing number of young Japanese are booking trips to New York and San Francisco, Japanese travel agents say.   Just why the Government and economists are taking notice is clear from the impact the travel boom is having on Japan's current account, the broadest measure of a nation's trade performance with the rest of the world, including trade in both goods and services.   In the first 10 months of this year, Japan's current-account surplus shrank in dollar terms by 23.5 percent, to $48.6 billion, from the period a year earlier. Government economists now predict that for the full year the current-account surplus could be less than $60 billion, well under the $71 billion forecast earlier and down sharply from the peak of $87 billion in 1987. Would Slow Rise in Wealth    To be sure, there are many frictions between the United States and Japan that a reduction in the current-account surplus would not solve. These include American assertions that Japanese markets remain closed to items like semiconductors, wood products, supercomputers and satellites. But a sustained decline in the current-account surplus would slow Japan's extraordinary accumulation of wealth in recent years.   In the arithmetic of trade figures, the travel deficit is part of the ledger dealing with ''invisible trade,'' which includes services, fees, royalties and investment income. The other part of the ledger concerns merchandise, or ''visible,'' trade. Most of the negotiations between the United States and Japan have been over the merchandise trade balance.   A declining Japanese current-account surplus could have a significant impact on Japan's purchasing power abroad, reducing its investment in the United States on everything from real estate to Treasury bonds and hampering the competitiveness of Japanese banks overseas.   ''This is why you hear the Japanese Government talking a lot more about the current account than the visible trade balance, where there hasn't been as much progress,'' said Kenneth S. Courtis, senior economist here for Deutsche Bank. ''And the travel deficit is behind it.''   Some economists agree with Mr. Watanabe that the travel boom could do more to shrink Japan's capital surpluses than all the measures being planned for increasing the country's imports and opening its markets to foreign goods. 'An Enormous New Market'    ''What people are starting to realize is that this is not just a change for Japanese consumers, but is changing consumption around the world because of how much Japanese tourists are spending overseas,'' Mr. Courtis said. ''You have some 10 million high spenders going abroad each year. It's an enormous new market that is going to continue to grow.''   On the front lines of this new army of travelers, life can be hectic. Takeshi Saito, manager of the overseas sales department for the bustling Shinjuku office of the Japan Travel Bureau, said his office's sales had more than doubled this year from 1988.   As young people nearby studied pamphlets for package trips to Australia, Hawaii and Europe, Mr. Saito noted that he had increased his staff by 30 percent to keep up with the demand. He pointed out that domestic travel has also boomed. A Different Tourist Now    Along with the boom is a change in the tourist, reflecting Japan's growing self-confidence. The days of Japanese travel groups moving through museums, hotels, restaurants and stores in lockstep, wearing the same tour hats, carrying the official tour bags and following a flag-waving tour leader also seem to be ending.   ''No more hats, no more bags,'' Mr. Saito said. ''Things have changed 100 percent. Especially the younger people. They want more free time when they get someplace.''   Many Japanese who make up the country's roving army of frequent fliers had to be forced as recently as two years ago to take Saturdays off and use their vacation time.   The Japanese Government lent its rhetorical support to the new spirit. Three years ago it declared its ''10 million plan,'' an effort to cajole that many Japanese to travel abroad. But the Government took almost no practical steps to raise interest in travel. Nonetheless, and to everyone's surprise, the goal has been met two years earlier than hoped.   Japan enforced rigorous travel restrictions in the postwar years to keep the nation's precious capital resources at home and to help rebuild the economy. 'Saved All the Time'    ''People were used to being conservative and saved all the time because the Government told them it was necessary,'' said Manabu Kanematsu, president of the Japan Association of Travel Agents, a trade group. ''But when they heard the Government, even the prime minister, encouraging them to use their savings and to travel, people really became more positive, more relaxed.''   Mr. Kanematsu also said that overseas travel has become a way for Japanese, whose living standard at home has been stunted by dauntingly high costs for housing and luxury goods, to begin to feel the wealth they had been reading about.   ''People who live in the smallest houses here want the biggest hotel rooms when they travel overseas,'' Mr. Kanematsu said.  The Japanese travel boom appears to have a great deal of room for growth. Compared with people in many other industrialized countries, Japanese are still homebodies. Britain, for example, with less than half the population of Japan, has three times as many overseas travelers.   ''They're way behind other countries,'' Mr. Courtis said. ''I think we can still expect a lot of catching up.''

Slain Newark Officer Recalled as Being a Hero Even Before Fatal Shot
INSIDE   Counting down to the liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery at 10:39 this morning, Bud Mann of Altoona, Fla., cooled off near Cape Canaveral. NASA says that risk of catastrophic failure is about 1 in 100, more than twice as great as an estimate issued before the loss of the Columbia in 2003. NASA put the chance of acceptable weather at 60 percent.   PAGE A14    2 Suspects Named in London  The British police have identified two of the four men suspected of trying to set off bombs last Thursday in London's transportation system. They also said the men used a type of plastic container for their devices that is sold in a number of stores in Britain.  PAGE A6    A Big Change in Boot Camp  Years ago, drill sergeants accused of abusing recruits might have been only reprimanded or transferred. That is no longer true. Just ask Staff Sgt. Michael G. Rhoades.  PAGE A12    Remaking a Face  After years of heated scientific debate over ethics and technical feasibility, the Cleveland Clinic has become the first medical institution to approve a face transplant. A team led by Dr. Maria Siemionow is seeking a patient to undergo the startling medical procedure.  SCIENCE TIMES, PAGE F1     Details on Bombings in Egypt  Egyptian officials, in the first detailed account of Saturday's terrorist attack at a resort on Egypt's Red Sea coast, said that the three explosions had been set off by suicide bombers and that police checkpoints might have forced two of the bombers to set off their explosives early, before reaching targets packed with Western tourists.  PAGE A3     Record Tower For Chicago  The Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava has designed what would be the country's tallest building, in Chicago. It would be 115 stories, topping out at 1,458 feet, with a spire that would reach about 2,000 feet. The developer, Christopher T. Carley, plans to announce the $500 million project today.  PAGE A13    Creating A Folk Hero  Millions of people have seen the frescoes of Constantino Brumidi, the Italian-born artist whose work decorates the United States Capitol. But most people don't know his name. It's one man's mission to restore luster and honors to Brumidi and, perhaps, make him an American folk hero.  PAGE E1

LEARNING BY EXAMPLE Teachers Know In the uproar over educational reform, few policy makers have concerned themselves to ask what teachers think. Now, two studies make clear the need to pay more attention to them. Three out of four of the 2,000 teachers canvassed by Louis Harris for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company feel that their views have been ignored in the long debate about educational reform. About half say they lack respect and support from parents and the community. Yet overwhelming majorities say they ''love to teach,'' welcome innovation in school management and support greater teacher accountability.

SQN##824623##President Boris N. Yeltsin, bristling over President Clinton's criticism of Russia's military assault on Chechnya, complained that the United States was not treating Russia with the respect due a nuclear power.    SQN##820741##U.S. ORDERS RUSSIAN OUT  The United States said it was expelling a Russian diplomat who was found with eavesdropping equipment outside the State Department.    SQN##824593##CONTAINING SPREAD OF WEAPONS  The United States should raise financial support for programs intended to prevent former Soviet scientists from working for rogue states and terrorists seeking unconventional weapons, a research group said.

SQN##822299##The Syrian government and its Arab allies spoke with customary caution even as they welcomed the planned resumption of peace talks between Syria and Israel.    SQN##819190##U.S. OFFERS KOSOVO TOLL  The State Department estimated that 10,000 Kosovar Albanians were killed in the Serbian campaign this year to force out the Albanian population, a figure nearly five times larger than the number of bodies unearthed from mass graves.
