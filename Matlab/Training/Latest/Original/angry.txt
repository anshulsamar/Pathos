to his publisher dear jay (james laughlin, of new directions): unless i am mistaken, which is likely enough, you may have taken my remarks on money in my last letter as a kind of hint, naturally enough. but i merely meant to report on what preoccupied me, which is the only way i can write letters, and i sincerely yearn for the day when our friendship is so pure that all my royalties can be assigned to some charitable cause such as a society for making it clear to the american people that (general) macarthur is an unspeakable ham. i have decided not to be a bank clerk, after all, since i would probably be paralyzed by the conflict between my desire to steal money and my fear of doing so. it was pleasant to learn that you expected our correspondence to be read in the international salons and boudoirs of the future. do you think they will be able to distinguish between the obfuscations, mystifications, efforts at humor, and plain statements of facts? will they recognize my prime feelings as a correspondent - the catacomb from which i write to you, seeking to secure some word from the real world, or at least news of the far west - and sigh with compassion? or will they just think that i am nasty, an over-eager clown, gauche, awkward and bookish? will they understand that i am always direct, open, friendly, simple and candid to the point of na"ivete until the ways of the fiendish world  me and i am forced to be devious, suspicious, calculating, not that it does me any good anyway? and for that matter what will they make of your complex character? . . . yours, delmore new york city may 8, 1951 -
