Built models to predict whether a news headline will cause a reader to be angry. Experimented with multiple models, collected data using the NYTimes API, used machine learning algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes), and ran error diagnostics. We attained accuracy between 70 - 75% across multiple data set sizes and
up to 86% on experimental models with a smaller set. 

This project was built by Anshul Samar and Bharad Raghavan for CS229 (Machine Learning) at Stanford University using open source machine learning and NLP tools.
